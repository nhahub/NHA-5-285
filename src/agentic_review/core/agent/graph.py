"""The review step's graph (research R-12, R-13, R-14, R-17, data-model §5).

Four nodes, one per phase: ``call_model`` sends the conversation; ``validate_calls`` validates each tool call in
order and answers every call with exactly one structured observation; ``record_coverage`` checks which reviewed
files this turn's calls named, cumulative across turns; ``decide_repair`` owes the **one** repair turn (FR-5.6c)
when the first pass owed one — a rejected call, or a reviewed file that no call ever named — carrying only what went
wrong, and is where the conditional edge back to ``call_model`` lives. No checkpointer: state is built fresh for
every review (FR-5.1).

``call_model`` also retries once, after a configurable wait, on a 429 from the provider (FR-11.2/research R-10's
provider-error mapping, narrowed to the one case with a well-known fix: wait). The retry is scoped to **that**
model call alone — earlier turns already in ``run.messages`` are untouched, so a 429 on a repair turn does not
repeat the first turn's call, let alone restart the review.
