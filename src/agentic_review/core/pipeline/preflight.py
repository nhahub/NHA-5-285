"""Preflight: everything that can stop a run is checked before any change is resolved or any model is called.

Checks run in the order of contracts/cli.md "Preflight messages" and stop at the first failure (FR-9.3 — partial:
the test-script prerequisite arrives in feature 002 — AC-9).

| # | Check | For a pull request (``--pr``) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Inside a git repository | The URL is a GitHub pull request URL — no repository is needed |
| 2 | Configuration valid | Only ``--config`` or the defaults: never a file from the pull request (FR-10.3d) |
| 3 | Scope arguments coherent | ``--pr`` excludes ``--scope`` and ``--head`` |
| 4 | Credential available | The same |
| 5 | Named refs exist | The pull request is opened — the only step that uses the network, and so the last |

The ``staged`` scope and its checks arrive with User Story 4. Until then check 3 refuses it: the config schema accepts
it, so a file written now stays valid later (FR-1.2d), but asking for it must not reach the resolver.

Check 4 establishes that a credential **can** be found; it does not hand the credential on. ``PreflightOk`` becomes
pipeline state, and pipeline state is what every tracer attached to the graph receives and ships, so the value is
looked up again by the one step that gives it to the model client.
