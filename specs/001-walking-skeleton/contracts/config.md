# Contract: `.agentic-review.yml` and the Credential (001)

**Parent contract**: [`Docs/design/04-contracts.md`](../../../Docs/design/04-contracts.md) §7 and
[`05-cross-cutting.md`](../../../Docs/design/05-cross-cutting.md) §4. Stability: 📦 versioned by `schemaVersion`.

The other side of this contract is **the user's repository**: a file written against 001 must stay valid in 006.

---

## The file

Read from the repository root, or from `--config PATH`. Every field is optional. The types, defaults and
per-field effect in 001 are in [data-model.md §7](../data-model.md#7--cf-9--configuration).

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1

scope: working-tree                  # working-tree | staged | range
exclude:                             # ADDED to the default list below, never replacing it
  - "**/*.generated.ts"

context:                             # accepted and validated; no effect until feature 004
  depth: 1
  node: node

checks:                              # accepted and validated; no effect until feature 002
  tests:
    command: ["npm", "test"]
    timeoutSeconds: 120              # PLACEHOLDER, not a finding - SRS section 8, TBD-4
  typecheck:
    command: ["npx", "tsc", "--noEmit"]

agent:
  toolCallCeiling: 25                # PLACEHOLDER - SRS section 8, TBD-8
  investigationTools: false          # true is accepted, has no effect until feature 005, and is reported
  model: "meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"   # PLACEHOLDER - chosen by test S-1
  baseUrl: "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
  temperature: 0
  requestTimeoutSeconds: 60          # PLACEHOLDER - additive field, see plan D-9

budget:
  maxTokens: 20000                   # PLACEHOLDER - SRS section 8, TBD-3
```

## Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| File absent → built-in defaults | FR-1.2b |
| Field absent → that field's default; merging is **per field**, never whole-section replacement | FR-1.2c, 05 §4.1 |
| Invalid value, **unknown field**, **duplicate key**, or YAML syntax error → exit 3, naming the file and the dotted field path (or line and column for syntax) | FR-1.2d, spec Assumptions, R-8 |
| `exclude` is **added to** the defaults | FR-008, SC-009 |
| Order of precedence: defaults → file → CLI flags | 05 §4.1 |
| Settings for unbuilt capabilities: validated, no effect, **one** stderr notice listing the dotted paths that were set | FR-003 |
| **There is no credential field.** A key such as `apiKey` anywhere in this file is an unknown field, so exit 3 | FR-1.3a, FR-004 |

## Default exclusion list

The rule names appear in the report's `changeSummary.excluded[].rule`. Glob semantics: `**` matches zero or more
path segments; `*` and `?` stay within one segment; a pattern with no `/` matches at any depth.

| Rule | Patterns |
|---|---|
| `default:dependencies` | `node_modules/**` · `**/node_modules/**` · `vendor/**` · `bower_components/**` |
| `default:build-output` | `dist/**` · `build/**` · `out/**` · `coverage/**` · `.next/**` · `.nuxt/**` · `.turbo/**` |
| `default:generated` | `**/*.generated.*` · `**/*.gen.ts` · `**/__generated__/**` |
| `default:minified` | `**/*.min.js` · `**/*.min.mjs` · `**/*.map` |
| `default:lockfile` | `package-lock.json` · `yarn.lock` · `pnpm-lock.yaml` · `bun.lockb` |

A configured pattern `p` is recorded as `config:p`. If a path matches both a default and a configured pattern, the
**default** rule is recorded, because defaults are applied first.

## The credential

| Order | Source | Location |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Environment | `AGENTIC_REVIEW_API_KEY` |
| 2 | User-level file | Windows `%APPDATA%\agentic-review\credentials.yml`; otherwise `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agentic-review/credentials.yml`, falling back to `~/.config/agentic-review/credentials.yml`. Contents: `apiKey: <key>` |

- If the user-level file resolves to a path **inside the repository root**, it is refused (exit 3), because FR-1.3a
  forbids reading it from a file in the repository.
- Neither source available → exit 3, naming both locations.
- The value **never** appears in stdout, stderr, the report, a log record, or an exception message shown to the
  user (SC-007).
