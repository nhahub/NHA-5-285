# Contract: Internal Seams (001)

These are **not** user-facing. They are the Python boundaries that the constitution's structural principles (II, III)
and the frozen interfaces (SRS §5) depend on, so they are written down before tasks are generated. Everything
else is ordinary code.

Signatures are indicative: names may be refined during implementation, but **the direction of each dependency and what
crosses each seam may not** without revisiting this plan.

---

## 1 · Pipeline: the only owner of order (ADR-0001) · `core/pipeline/`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ReviewRequest:
    cwd: Path
    scope: ScopeKind | None          # None = not given on the command line
    base: str | None
    config_path: Path | None
    ceiling: int | None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PreflightFailure:
    message: str                     # already redacted; the CLI prints it to stderr

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Reviewed:
    report: ReviewReport             # verdict already computed in core
    ignored_settings: tuple[str, ...]

def run_review(
    request: ReviewRequest,
    *,
    env: Mapping[str, str],
    clock: Callable[[], float] = time.monotonic,
    now: Callable[[], datetime] = utc_now,
    review_port: ReviewPort | None = None,   # None = build the default through core/agent
) -> PreflightFailure | Reviewed: ...
```

Order: **preflight → change set → [nothing to review? → output] → assembly → [budget exhausted? → output] →
review → output**. After preflight nothing raises (Principle V). Every stage that runs is timed.

## 2 · Change set: producer of the frozen structure · `core/changeset/`

```python
def locate_repository(cwd: Path) -> Path | None: ...
def ref_exists(repo_root: Path, ref: str) -> bool: ...
def head_is_unborn(repo_root: Path) -> bool: ...
def resolve(repo_root: Path, scope: ScopeRequest, exclude: Sequence[str]) -> ChangeSet: ...
def measure_new_files(change_set: ChangeSet) -> Mapping[str, int]: ...   # reviewable files only
def summarise(change_set: ChangeSet) -> ChangeSummary: ...
```

The **only** package that runs git (R-3). `ChangeSet` is what v3's Action adapter will produce by other means
(FR-10.3c), so nothing downstream may reach past it to git.

## 3 · Assembly: the only budget owner · `core/assembly/`

```python
def assemble(change_set: ChangeSet, line_counts: Mapping[str, int], budget: BudgetSettings
             ) -> ReviewContext | BudgetExhausted: ...
```

## 4 · Review port: provider-independent (FR-0.3) · protocol in `core/findings/`, implementation in `core/agent/`

```python
class ReviewPort(Protocol):
    def review(self, context: ReviewContext) -> ReviewOutcome: ...

# core/agent/ - the ONLY module importing langchain_* / langgraph / openai
def build_review_port(settings: AgentSettings, credential: Credential,
                      *, chat_model: BaseChatModel | None = None) -> ReviewPort: ...
```

`chat_model` is the test injection point for the scripted stand-in (R-19). Production passes `None`, and
`ChatOpenAI` is built inside.

## 5 · Findings: validation · `core/findings/`

```python
def validate_call(name: str, args: object, material: RunMaterial) -> Accepted | Rejected: ...
def tool_schema() -> dict: ...                   # generated from FindingDraft, refs inlined
def report_schema() -> dict: ...                 # generated from ReviewReport
def fingerprint(draft: FindingDraft) -> str: ...
```

These are pure functions with no I/O, so they can be tested without a framework in the fixture (FR-5.8).

## 6 · Output: verdict and rendering · `core/output/`

```python
def compute_verdict(completion: CompletionStatus, findings: Sequence[Finding]) -> Verdict: ...
def build_report(...) -> ReviewReport: ...
def render_terminal(report: ReviewReport, console: rich.console.Console) -> None: ...
def to_json(report: ReviewReport) -> str: ...
```

`render_terminal` and `to_json` take the **same** `ReviewReport` (FR-027). Neither recomputes anything.

## 7 · CLI: translation only · `cli/`

The CLI parses flags (after the `--json` argv normalisation, R-18), calls `run_review`, chooses streams, writes, and maps
`report.verdict` → exit code. It contains **no** logic that decides what is a finding (FR-10.2), and nothing imports
it (import contract 6).
