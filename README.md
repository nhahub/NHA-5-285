# agentic-review

A local command-line reviewer for TypeScript and JavaScript changes. It resolves a change set, passes it to a single model pass, and reports schema-validated findings in the terminal, as JSON and as a self-contained HTML page. A finding can enter the system only through a validated `emit_finding` tool call, and every degraded run says what it could not do.

**Status:** the walking skeleton (feature 001) is built: the `review` and `render` commands, the working-tree, branch-range and public pull-request scopes, and the terminal, JSON and HTML outputs. Running the reviewed project's tests and type check, gathering related context, the pattern library and the `regression` command are not built yet. [`Docs/operation_guidelines.md`](./Docs/operation_guidelines.md) §11 lists everything that is missing.

## Install

Requires git, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and CPython 3.12 or 3.13.

```
uv sync
```

## Run

The tool needs a provider key (NVIDIA NIM by default) in `AGENTIC_REVIEW_API_KEY` or in the user-level credentials file. Never put the key in the repository.

```
cp .env.example .env          # then set AGENTIC_REVIEW_API_KEY
uv run --env-file .env agentic-review review                                  # uncommitted changes
uv run --env-file .env agentic-review review --scope range --base main        # what this branch changed
uv run --env-file .env agentic-review review --pr https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/N
uv run --env-file .env agentic-review review --json report.json --html report.html
uv run agentic-review render report.json --html report.html                   # re-render a saved report
```

Exit codes: `0` the review completed, `1` it found a `blocking` finding, `2` no review could be produced, `3` the run could not start. `uv run agentic-review review --help` lists every option. The full guide to configuration, results and troubleshooting is [`Docs/operation_guidelines.md`](./Docs/operation_guidelines.md).

## Develop

```
uv run pytest           # the offline test suite
uv run lint-imports     # the structural import contracts
```
